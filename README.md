# Schrödinger’s Bat: Diffusion Models Sometimes Generate Polysemous Words in Superposition

## Paper

This repository contains code accompanying ['Schrödinger’s Bat: Diffusion Models Sometimes Generate Polysemous Words in Superposition'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.13095.pdf) by Jennifer C. White and Ryan Cotterell (pre-print).

## Details

The notebook `experiments.ipynb` contains code that will run all of the experiments described in the paper.

An authorisation key for Stable Diffusion is required.

We ran the original experiments using Google Colab.
